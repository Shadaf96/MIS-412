                and make you're first to show a pleasurable experience.

            <p>If you’re lucky or connected, you can get an invite, sans the price tag. 
                But I wasn’t so lucky or connected my first two years,
                so I’m here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you
                and make a schedule, and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET.
                If you’re worried about blowing your cash the whole time, you won’t have fun.
                Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most.
                Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!</p>

            <p>Always be true to your sense of style, if you don’t,
            you’ll be uncomfortable the whole time, and it will show.
            Remember, Paris Fashion Week is about expressing yourself
            and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new lines.
            Also, it’s important to wear shoes; you’ll be comfortable all day.
            Obviously, you want to look good, but you’ll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
